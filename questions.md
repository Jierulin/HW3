1. for and while do the same work.
    Only difference they have is that for function condenses the steps in while loop into one line.
2. 1st part of for loop sets the variable. 
    2nd part sets the conditions during which you want to execute the loop. 
    3rd part sets how you want to change the variable.
3. Nested loops means a for loop contain another for loop, meaning do the 1st for loop and do the 2nd loop at the same time.
